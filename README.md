This is a 24 hour challenge to create a landing site for a new film.

I have chosen to design a site for The Green Book, a "biographical comedy-drama" set in 1962.

I saw an opportunity to breathe more life into the marketing aspects of the film, and to help reflect the message of the film visually.
